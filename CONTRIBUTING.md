# Contributing

This project is open for all developers for contribution, so it's important we establish some contribution guidelines.

## General Guidelines

-   No pushing to master without opening a pull request (The only exceptions are small hotfixes, any new features or such MUST go in a new branch)
-   Must be backwards compatible down to Java 11
-   Javadoc your code according to google's [Javadoc guidlines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s7-javadoc)

## Pull Requests

-   Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
-   Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
-   Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.
-   You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or 1 lead developer or higher, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
